## About

Nexter project is part of an online course "Advanced CSS and SASS" in Udemy by Jonas. I converted the design to HTML and CSS. This project is uploaded for demonstration purposes only. As the design author has permitted to use the design to his students (since I was one I have permission). So please don't copy the design to claim as your own.
Layout is done using CSS Grid which is compatible with most browsers (Internet Explorer not supported). 7-1 folder architecture is used with BEM class naming. This website is responsive supporting devices with variety of screen sizes. Since CSS grid is relatively new and modern feature, browsers 4 or 5 years old may not support it.
