# Nexter By Shariul

## About

Nexter project is part of an online course "Advanced CSS and SASS" in Udemy by Jonas. I converted the design to HTML and CSS. This project is uploaded for demonstration purposes only.
Layout is done using CSS Grid which is compatible with most browsers (Internet Explorer not supported). 7-1 folder architecture is used with BEM class naming. This website is responsive supporting devices with variety of screen sizes. Since CSS grid is relatively new and modern feature, browsers 4 or 5 years older may not support it.
